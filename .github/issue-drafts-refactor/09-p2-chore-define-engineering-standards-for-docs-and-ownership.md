Title: [P2][Chore]: Define engineering standards for function docs and module ownership

Body:
### Priority
P2 - Medium

### Area
Tooling

### Summary
Documentation quality and module ownership rules are currently inconsistent across the project.

### Engineering Value
- Consistent technical documentation quality.
- Faster onboarding and safer refactor decisions.
- Clear ownership boundaries for cross-page runtime code.

### Proposed Mitigation
- Add engineering standards doc covering:
  - function documentation expectations
  - naming conventions
  - module boundaries and ownership
  - refactor PR quality checklist

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Engineering standards doc exists and is linked in `README.md`.
- [ ] Public/shared function documentation expectations are defined.
- [ ] Module ownership/boundary rules are explicit.
